# Crafting Interpreters

I try to create my own interpreter using as guide the **Crafting Interpreters** written by Robert Nystrom. Is an incredible book which anyone can follow because it is available also from his personal blog [https://craftinginterpreters.com/](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The book is seperated into three parts:

### First Part
He analyses how a programming language works. What happened in compile time. What is the difference between Compiler, Interpreter and Bytecode Compilation.

### Second Part
He starts to create an interpreter using Java (but as you can see this repository is C#. I try to port the Java code into C#). The second part starts to explain and code everything that had mentioned in the first part.

### Third Part
In the last part, he is using C to create from scratch a bytecode compiler. With its own VM to run in multiple platforms.

# About Repository
Repository have created with .NET 8 with AOT Support.
